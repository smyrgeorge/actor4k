# actor4k

A small actor system written in kotlin using Coroutines (kotlinx.coroutines).

The main goal is to build a minimal actor system that can work in cluster mode.

**NOTE:** Until it's a toy project and of course is not ready for production use.

## Work in progress

The project is in a very early stage.
Check the `examples` for additional info.

## Todo

A lot of things need to be done, so sit tightâ€¦

- [ ] Cluster - Sharding (in progress)
    - [ ] Use `raft` consensus algorithm for the cluster node membership (in progress).
    - [ ] Do not use SWIM, just use raft and gRPC.
    - [x] Implement `tell/ask` patterns across cluster nodes
    - [x] Add support for cross-node actor reference
    - [x] Introduce the concept of Shard.
    - [ ] Shard rebalancing.
- [ ] Serialization (in progress)
    - [x] Send messages across cluster using the gossip protocol
    - [x] Use gRPC for the communication across cluster nodes
    - [ ] Use protobuf for all messages (in progress)
- [ ] Metrics (in progress)
- [ ] Logging (in progress)
- [ ] Java compatibility
- [ ] Persistence

## Run the example.

The included example tries to simulate a very simple bank system.

It defines a `AccountActor` that can handle only two simple commands,
`Req.GetAccount` and `Req.ApplyTx`.

The client `examples-bank-client` generates traffic.
At the end will check the available balance (should be zero).

So, with this example we validate the cluster consistency.

Run the following script (it will also build the project).

```shell
./run.sh
```

The above script will do the following:

- Build the project.
- Build the docker image `actor4k-bank:latest`.
- Run the `docker compose` that will start:
    - 3 custer bank nodes
    - a nginx acting as the loadbalancer

If everything goes well, you should see something like the following (`mPS` ping messages per second):

Then you can run the `bank-client` in order to generate some traffic:

```shell
java -jar examples-bank-client/build/libs/examples-bank-client-0.1.0.jar
```

### Cleanup

```shell
./gradelw clean && docker compose down -v
```

## Build

```shell
./gradlew build
```

### Docker

```shell
docker build . -t actor4k -f examples/src/main/docker/Dockerfile
```
