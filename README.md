# actor4k

A small actor system written in kotlin using Coroutines (kotlinx.coroutines).

The main goal is to build a minimal actor system that can work in cluster mode.

For this particular reason we make use of `scalecube-cluster` (implementation of SWIM).

## Todo

A lot of things need to be done, so sit tightâ€¦

- [ ] Cluster/Sharding (in progress)
- [ ] Logging (in progress)
- [ ] Serialization
- [ ] Java compatibility
- [ ] Metrics
- [ ] Persistence

## Work in progress

The project is in a very early stage.
Check the `examples` for additional info.

## Build

```shell
./gradlew build
```

### Docker

```shell
docker build . -t actor4k -f examples/src/main/docker/Dockerfile
```

## Run

```shell
java -jar examples/build/libs/*.jar
```

```shell
docker compose up
```
