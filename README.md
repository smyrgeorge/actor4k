# actor4k

A small actor system written in kotlin using Coroutines (kotlinx.coroutines).

The main goal is to build a minimal actor system that can work in cluster mode.

For this particular reason we make use of `scalecube-cluster` (implementation of SWIM).

## Todo

A lot of things need to be done, so sit tightâ€¦

- [ ] Cluster
- [ ] Persistence
- [ ] Serialization
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Metrics
- [ ] Java compatibility

## Work in progress
The project is in a very early stage.
Check the `examples` for additional info.
